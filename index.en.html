		<ul>
                    <li>The treatments which allows the sludge recovery require the implementation of such processes as the anaerobic digestion. This treatment offers a strong economic advantage due to the produced biogas and a transformation in biomethane which allow the reinjection in the natural gas network.

                    <li>Sludge produced respond more and more to strong constraints and requirements, as dryness, the stabilization, the harmlessness and the traceability. The final routes of disposal and reuses are becoming reduced, whereas the quantities of produced sludge increase ceaselessly. 

                    <li>Selecting the best processes that allow to reach the final route is a strong part of a sustainable development policy and a medium–term cost control for communities.

                    <li>In the face of the problem, ENVIRO-CONSULT acquired a know-how recognized for the technical and economic approach of drying processes routes and developed tools of analysis allowing to make the comparison between:
